tic tac toe
Developed a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python, demonstrating proficiency in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. The game was built to allow two players to engage in a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, following standard rules and gameplay. Key functionalities of the game include:

Board Display: Created a function to print the current state of the game board in a user-friendly format.

Winning Conditions: Implemented logic to check for winning conditions, verifying if any player has completed a row, column, or diagonal with their symbols.

Tie Condition: Designed a mechanism to detect a tie game when all the squares on the board are filled.

Player Moves: Enabled players to input their moves, considering valid moves and preventing players from choosing already occupied squares.

Turn Management: Managed the alternating turns of players, ensuring smooth gameplay until a win or a tie.

The project highlighted my proficiency in handling user input, designing algorithmic solutions, and creating interactive command-line applications. Additionally, it showcased my ability to manage game states, implement conditional checks, and create an engaging user experience through the terminal interface."
